## Blog with Nextjs, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and GraphCMS

This project is a blog created with the following technologies:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): A React-based framework for building server-rendered or statically-exported apps.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- [GraphCMS](https://hygraph.com/): A headless content management system (CMS) for creating and managing content through a flexible GraphQL API.

### Features

- Server-rendered pages for improved SEO and performance.
- TypeScript for type checking and improved developer experience.
- Responsive design with TailwindCSS.
- Dynamic content management with GraphCMS.
